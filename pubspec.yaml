# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  generate: true
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/svg/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Mona Sans
      fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Mona-Sans.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf     
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf 
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Italic.ttf 
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf 
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf 
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf 
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf 
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBoldItalic.ttf 
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
